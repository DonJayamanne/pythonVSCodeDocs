## 1. <a id="Incompatible-dependencies"></a>Incompatible dependencies
The Python extension has a dependency on the [jmp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jmp) module. 
Due to technical limitations, this module will only work with specific versions of Visual Studio Code.  
As and when new versions of Visual Studio Code are released, a new version of this [Python extenion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python) will have to be released as well.

### Solution 
As mentioned earlier, at this stage this issue can only be resolved by creating a new release of the [Python extenion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python). 
If one hasn't already been released, then please create an issue [here](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/issues).
