title: Prerequisites

Before you start using Jupyter with Visual Studio Code you will need to ensure you have either Jupyter _**or**_ IPython installed locally.  
Note: You need to install either Jupyter or IPython.  
 
#### [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html)
- [Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda](http://jupyter.org/install.html)  
- [Alternative for experienced Python users: Installing Jupyter with pip](http://jupyter.org/install.html)  
    + As an existing Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Pythonâ€™s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.    
    + First, ensure that you have the latest pip; older versions may have trouble with some dependencies:    
      ```pip3 install --upgrade pip```  
    + Then install the Jupyter Notebook using:    
      ```pip3 install jupyter```  
    + Use pip if using legacy Python 2.

#### [IPython](https://ipython.org/install.html)
- If you already have Python installed and are familiar with installing packages, you can get IPython with pip:  
    ```pip install ipython```

### Getting started
Once the Prerequisites have been installed and setup you might want to have a look at the [Getting Started](/docs/jupyter_getting-started/) section or the [Examples](/docs/jupyter_examples/) section.
